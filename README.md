# YourDataBase
Your personal database to which you add the necessary files yourself
This script creates a folder in the folder where the python file is located. Next, you need to add CSV format databases and the script will be able to read them. This code is adapted to Russia and Russian phone numbers, so it may not work correctly with others. 

Don't forget to install the python library necessary for the script!
